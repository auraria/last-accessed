# last-accessed
This is a powershell script that's useful in forensics for identifying last accessed and created times on files.

# Script

This is a very simple script, I usually use this by manually typing it out so I've decided to make it a script.
Generally run this against remote hosts in user profiles, and is easily customizable.

Make sure to run admin.

# Future

Probably going to make this take an input of an ip or a hostname from CLI so you don't have to modify the file all the time.
